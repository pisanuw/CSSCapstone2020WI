      <h2>Sessions Overview</h2>

      <p>
        <a href="https://washington.zoom.us/j/774803693">Lobby Zoom</a>: Any
        last minute announcements will be posted in the Lobby Zoom. You can
        also come in here to text or video chat with other
        attendees. Meeting ID: 774 803 693
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Zoom Etiquette</strong>: Mute your microphone. Turn on your
        video if possible, so you are providing an engaged audience rather
        than a blank page to the presenter. If you have a question, use
        "Raise Hand" under Participants in Zoom controls. At the end of the
        presentation, use "Clap" under Reactions to show your appreciation
        of the presentation. Treat being a Zoom audience similar to being an
        audience in a regular presentation, excessive fidgeting or moving
        around can be distracting to the presenter.

      <p><strong>Industry Sponsor:</strong> University of Washington Bothell</p>
      <p><strong>Faculty Advisor:</strong> Wooyoung Kim</p>
      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Network Motifs are statistically unique subgraph patterns that exist in networks. Identifying them is an important task but can be also quite time consuming and expensive. One of the solutions, the Network Motif Library, also known as “NemoLib”, significantly reduces the cost and time necessary to identify these subgraph patterns. 
        NemoLib was originally written using Java, and later C++. The C++ version lacked multiple features that the current version of NemoLib Java and had a significantly slower runtime compared to the Java version. In order to improve upon the current C++ version, the application was extended to include the additional functionality that it lacked, its data was verified for correctness, and various methodologies were tested and implemented to improve it.
        By reducing the overhead during execution and fixing some bugs that caused the C++ version to incorrectly parse information, the runtime was drastically reduced. With the newly implemented changes, the C++ version is now a more competitive option on the market.</p>

      <p><strong>Building a web application to remotely access electrical engineering labs</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Student Defined - Group Project</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Sponsor:</strong> Arnold Berger</p>
      <p><strong>Faculty Advisor:</strong> Min Chen</p>
      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The goal of the project is to create a website that will allow UW students to reserve and remotely access lab machines. The lab machines are Windows computers that are connected to an ELVIS device that the lab will be performed with. UW Bothell’s Electric Engineering students will be able to work on labs from their homes. The design of the project consists of multiple parts, a website, a database, and remote desktop setup for the machines. For the website, I have used some open-source appointment scheduling skeleton to expand upon for this use case. I have changed the access to the website to only allow UW netid accounts to access the appointment creation. Appointments are 2 hour long sessions that can be reserved by any UW student or faculty. The appointment can be accessed on the website during the reserved time. A Remote Desktop Connection file will be downloaded that will connect to the reserved computer. A database on one of the lab machines is running a MySQL 5.6 server. The database stores all of the appointment, user, lab, and computer information. The website is hosted by UW’s vergil web host and is then able to connect safely to the lab machine’s server. The rest of the project is setting up the computers to be able to manage permissions for the remote desktop connections. This is done with PowerShell scripts that are run through the task scheduler at different times of the day. The scripts access the database and if that machine has an appointment, the NetID will be added to the remote desktop permissions. Every 2 hours, if there is an upcoming appointment warning will be put out and then users will be disconnected and removed from the permissions, so the next user will be able to access the lab. Documentation has also been created to help future students improve or change the current system.

      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This past summer, I completed a Nike Global Technology Internship down in Beaverton, Oregon at the Nike World Headquarters. I was an intern on the Personalization Team within the Nike Global Technology Department. Our Personalization team's general goal was to serve product recommendations through any of the Nike platforms such as the Nike Running Club App, Nike Training Club App, Nike.com, etc. using Machine Learning models. In addition to serving recommendations for our end users, our Personalization team also created and provided some of the tools supporting the end-to-end development and deployment of machine learning models for Data Scientists, so that they were able to own the lifecycle of their models with no need for handing it over to other teams. The software engineering team that I was a part of was involved in the Agile Software Development process with one month long Sprints and also heavily leaned on the successful Consumer Direct Offense business model for impacting consumers.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This capstone project is from the
        EYE center at the University of Washington Bothell research
        lab. The project is focused on the vision screening tool for the
        children in order to raise awareness of the importance of
        functional vision in children for learning.

        This capstone brought me to experience an how to iterate

      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The main purpose of this capstone
        project was to create a virtual reality application to help
        individuals overcome their fear of public speaking. Users
        would be able to practice their presentations in different
        environments with a populated and attentive audience, and
        thereafter receive informative feedback statistics regarding
        filler words, eye contact and more based on their performance.

        This project was a collaboration with two other individuals,
        each working on a different aspect of the project such as
        hardware integration, creating feedback scripts and audience
        population. I was tasked with 3D modeling of environments and
        their usability testing, creating audio and visual menus
        including their interface and associated scripts in C#,
        creating a topic bank and code to randomly select topics and
        integration testing.

        The first step in building this application was to design and
        map out the features required for the beta, and assigning
        tasks to team members. Research was done regarding each
        feature in order to find the most efficient and accurate way
        of implementing it. The next step was to code that technique
        and perform integration testing with the Unity cloud build.

        Also involved with this project was participating in an agile
        work environment, including monitoring a Trello board, giving
        weekly progress updates and participating in meetings.

        The results attained were satisfactory as the beta we intended
        was successfully built and tested, even if they were slower
        than desired.

      <p><strong>Sponsor:</strong> Edwin Melville Green</p>
      <p><strong>Faculty Advisor:</strong> William Erdly</p>
      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> During my internship with Clapped I worked on creating a web application product for their client Mentorite. The idea was to make a website that allows people to better learn new things and improve existing skills through mentorship. This application would improve job satisfaction overall and allow for employees to more easily work in their preferred roles or help them work towards this in an achievable way. 
        We were making this product because the client reached out and the idea seemed really useful and realistic in terms of possibility for us to implement. 
        Though the project was ditched in the end by Mentorite, we still continued with production and Clapped created a great environment for me to learn how to go from start to finish in learning how to develop a product.
        There is currently no product like this out on the market, so creating this was innovative and useful. This would allow for developers like the ones in big tech companies such as Microsoft can develop their own worth and be satisfied with their roles and need for a variety of work. Allowing for people to better themselves within a company creates a good impression of the company and allows these team members to become individually more skilled and valuable.</p>

      <p><strong>Faculty Advisor:</strong> Yusuf Pisan</p>
      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>During the summer of 2019, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon. I worked on team COSMOS, where the main responsibility is to analyze and act on sellers who attempt to defraud Amazon. My project was to extend the main tool that my team owns, the COSMOS Dashboard, which will help our main clients: machine learning scientists. They utilize our tool to improve their machine learning models and get the results they want to stop bad sellers from abusing our system.

        The first part of my project involved displaying vital information to the Dashboard. Since the backend code was already working, all I had to do was add this to the frontend using JSP and CSS. The second part of the project was to interview our stakeholders and clients of the team’s internal tool. I conducted seven interviews with machine learning scientists who use our tool, gaining valuable feedback from them about how to better our service. I identified the problems, grouped the similar ones, and prioritized them before adding them to a backlog of Dashboard tickets. Out of these tickets, I was able to address the UI needs. In the third and final part of the project, I integrated the information I added in the first part with more information obtained from another team’s APIs. I extended the Java backend code to get this information from the APIs and displayed the information using JSP. After displaying this information, I used CSS, JSP, and a little bit of JavaScript on the web page to enhance the look.

        As a software engineer, I gathered requirements through client interviews, created a wireframe model for a web page, and acquired permission to use another team’s APIs after convincing them.

        At the end of my internship, I demonstrated my work to my team, stakeholders, clients, and director. The response was positive, as this addition to the tool will help give a holistic view on why an action on a seller was made.</p>
